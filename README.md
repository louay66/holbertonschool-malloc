# C-malloc

Virtual Memory: malloc, the heap & the program break

## Description

This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of virtual memory and the concepts of `malloc`, the heap, and the program break. It consists of three tasks: implementing a native `malloc` function, implementing a `malloc` function using virtual memory, and building a `free` function to release allocated memory.

## Features

- Native `malloc`: Implementation of a basic memory allocation function without utilizing virtual memory.
- `malloc` with virtual memory: Implementation of the `malloc` function utilizing virtual memory to allocate memory dynamically.
- `free`: Implementation of a function to release allocated memory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/louay66/holbertonschool-malloc.git

```

## Usage

1-Include the relevant header file(s) in your program:

```
#include "malloc.h"
```

2-Utilize the functions in your code. For example, to allocate memory:

```
void* ptr = my_malloc(size);
```

3-Compile your program with the necessary flags and libraries. For example:

```
gcc -o program program.c malloc.o
```

4-Execute your program:

```
./my_program
```
